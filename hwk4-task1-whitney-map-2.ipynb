    "## About the data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task you will use two datsets:\n",
    "\n",
    "**First dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "A small section of the GAP/LANDFIRE National Terrestrial Ecosystems data for 2011, from the US Geological Survey (USGS). This is a raster file with a 30 m x 30 m pixel resolution. Each cell in the raster has a number representing the type of land cover.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was pre-processed in the Microsoft Planetary Computer to show a small region around Mount Whitney in California.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further information about the dataset can be accessed via the the datasetâ€™s Digital Object Identifier (DOI) link:\n",

    "## Data access\n",
    "The .tif file (same as we used in discussion section) is in the Canvas-week7-homework zip file. The California shapefile will be directly accessed via its URL."
